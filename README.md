# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of PyBer Analysis
This analysis was meant to show how Matplotlib can be used to express large data sets in a format within Python, offering a more unified way to analyze data.
## Results
The following is a chart showing the overall data on rideshare drivers and fares: <img width="593" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-22 at 9 56 42 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86446572/130379743-6642f0ef-2680-44eb-87fd-847a1593ff7d.png">

While urban areas consistently had the highest fees per ride, rural drivers average completing over 2 times the rides of urban drivers; meaning rural drivers have a more consistent income than urban drivers. However, since urban fares lead to the highest share of income for the ride-sharing app, it is most profitable to further invest in urban areas, despite the lower wages drivers recieve there. 

## Summary
The ride-sharing app should increase drivers in urban and suburban areas so their income can compete with urban areas, and consider increasing their share of wages to keep incentivizing drivers to be quickly accessible to riders.
